### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a master student in fluid mechanics at Beihang University â€‘ CentraleSupÃ©lec, under the supervision of *Prof. Fang Le*. 
- Languages: Mandarin/English/French,  OR  Fortran/C++/Python
- ðŸ¤” Research interest:theoretical analysis of fluid mechanics
- ðŸ”­ Current project: analysis of 2D compressible turbulence energy transfer
- ðŸŒ± Competences: Finite Element Methods, Discontinuous Galerkin Method, High Performance Calculation
- ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me *via* [chensheng_luo@buaa.edu.cn](mailto:chensheng_luo@buaa.edu.cn)
- âš¡ Personal interests: rail transit, orienteering, phonectics
### Experiences & Interesting Repos.
#### Mechanics
- Dynamic Arlequin Coupling Method Solver Code [CArl](https://github.com/cottereau/CArl/tree/dyncoup) in dyncoup branch
- Compressible Fluid Solver by using Discontinous Galerkin method (Not open source as an internship project)
- Compressible turbulence simulation code usage: I use code [astr](https://github.com/astr-code/astr) written by [Jian Fang](https://github.com/fangjian19) *et al.* and do several basic modifications, in order to help my theoretical study on turbulence. This work in done in a private branch of gitee.
- A personal mechanics toolset in [FluidMechanics-Tools](https://github.com/lcs27/FluidMechanics-Tools)
#### Templates
- [LaTeX-template](https://github.com/lcs27/LaTeX-template): A self-made 3 language template with pratical tools especially for mechanics
- [ECPKNStage](https://github.com/lcs27/ECPKNStage): Template for internship report of *Mission de fin d'Ã©tude* at *Ecole Centrale de PÃ©kin, Beihang University*
- [ECPKNProposal](https://github.com/lcs27/ECPKNProposal): Template for begin project report/ mid-term report of Master Thesis at *Ecole Centrale de PÃ©kin, Beihang University*
