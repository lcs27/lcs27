### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a master student in fluid mechanics at Beihang University â€‘ CentraleSupÃ©lec, under the supervision of *Prof. Fang Le*. 
- Languages: Mandarin/English/French,  OR  Fortran/C++/Python
- ðŸ¤” My research interest mainly relies on the theoretical analysis of fluid mechanics.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project about the analysis of 2D compressible turbulence, specially its energy transfer.
- ðŸŒ± I had experiences in Finite Element Methods, Discontinuous Galerkin Method and High Performance Calculation.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me *via* [chensheng_luo@buaa.edu.cn](mailto:chensheng_luo@buaa.edu.cn)
- âš¡ Personal interests: rail transit, orienteering, phonectics
### Experiences & Interesting Repos.
#### Mechanics
- Dynamic Arlequin Coupling Method Solver Code [CArl](https://github.com/cottereau/CArl/tree/dyncoup) in dyncoup branch
- Compressible Fluid Solver by using Discontinous Galerkin method (Not open source as a internship project) 
#### Templates
- [LaTeX-template](https://github.com/lcs27/LaTeX-template): A self-made 3 language template with pratical tools especially for mechanics
- [ECPKNStage](https://github.com/lcs27/ECPKNStage): Template for internship report of *Mission de fin d'Ã©tude* at *Ecole Centrale de PÃ©kin, Beihang University*
